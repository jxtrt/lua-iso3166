# Lua: ISO 3166

This module provides updated ISO 3166 data: A1, A2 and numeric lookups.

## Installation

Run `luarocks install iso3166`.

## Implementation

Currently only ISO 3166-1 codes are provided. 3166-2 subdivisions are planned but not yet here.

## Development

I plan on keeping this updated with every ISO revision, but pull requests are welcome if something is missing.

You will need the `luassert` package for testing, otherwise it's clone and go.
