# Lua: ISO 3166

This module provides updated ISO 3166 data.

## Implementation

Currently only ISO 3166-1 codes are provided. 3166-2 subdivisions are planned but not yet here.

## Development

I plan on keeping this updated with every ISO revision, but pull requests are welcome if something is missing.

You will need the luassert package for testing, otherwise it's clone and go.
